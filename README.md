# MECH105--Algorithms
These are the algorithms I created in MECH105  at Colorado State University 

### Binary Translater
In this code, I translated base 10 numbers into base 2. The end base 2 number would be presented in an array

### Root Finding - False Position 
This code estimates the root of a specific function
