# Simpson's 1/3 ALgorithm
This code computes the integral of a given function with values y in respect to x using the Simpson's 1/3 Composite Rule. 
- If there are an odd number of intervals, the last interval will be computed using the Trapezoidal Rule

## Inputs
* x
* y

## Outputs
* Integral

### x
x is a vector of equally spaced independant variables

### y
y is a vector of values given after a corresponding value of x is plugged into a function
